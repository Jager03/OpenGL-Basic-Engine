In this project for university I developed an application in C++ where I use OpenGL to render objects. 
Concepts from 3D space like meshes, animation, texturing and render pipline where applied for the construction of the project

In the glwidget.cc file is the implementation of the infinite for loop that renders each frame and listens to user input and in the object 3D class the 3D meshes are implemented using vertices and triangles.
